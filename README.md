# Proteus
3D printed parametric flying wing in OpenSCAD

This is a fast, efficient slope soarer, NOT suitable for beginners.

Note: this Openscad design has a large number of parameters such as sweep, washout, dihedral and many many more. Adjusting these parameters will result in a corresponding outer shell being generated, but may result in some internal structures not being correctly positioned, or possibly puncturing the shell, e.g. increasing the dihedral will cause the ends of the main carbon fiber tube spar to be exposed underneath the wing. These issues are fixable but overall it is a lot of work to get that right for all possible parameters.
